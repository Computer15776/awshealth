## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
awshealth is a utility that tracks public AWS Status events via the Health API. It stores pertinent event details for one year in a DynamoDB table, and then posts to a Discord webhook when status events occur, via DDB streams. Upon a prior existing event having one or more attributes changed; i.e. the event description is updated, awshealth will calculate the delta of the changes and post only the reflected changes.

This utility is split into two parts; `getEvents.py` which obtains a list of all AWS Health events and stores them in a DDB table, and `publishEvent.py` which publishes to Discord any new or modified events as they are written into the table.
